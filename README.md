## Discrete Probability Distributions

- This folder contains the calculation of the Binomial Distribution and the Poisson Distribution. The calculations are used for discrete probability distributions and can be used when not enough data is present to fill in the gaps in, for example, a histogram.

## Continuous Distributions

- The Gaussian distribution is used for continuous data. In order to calculate the Gaussian distribution, you need the mean and the standard deviation of the data.

- Exponential distributions are good for determining the likelihood of the time that passes between events.

- Uniform distributions can be used to generate random numbers (e.g. between 0 and 1)
