## Discrete Probability Distributions

- This folder contains the calculation of the Binomial Distribution and the Poisson Distribution. The calculations are used for discrete probability distributions and can be used when not enough data is present to fill in the gaps in, for example, a histogram.

## Continuous Distributions

- The Gaussian distribution is used for continuous data. In order to calculate the Gaussian distribution, you need the mean and the standard deviation of the data.

- Exponential distributions are good for determining the likelihood of the time that passes between events.

- Uniform distributions can be used to generate random numbers (e.g. between 0 and 1)

- Probability distributions are types of models that allow us to give approximations as if we had an unlimited amount of data.

## Models

- Models, such as the equation of a line, can tell us about data we have not measured yet.

- Since models are only approximations, we need to measure their quality - their distance from their predictions, using statistics

- Sum of squared residuals: One way to determine the quality of a models predictions

- The issue with the Sum of Squared Residuals is that it only tells us the residuals, not that a model is better or worse that another

- Mean Squared Error (average of SSR) can be used to compare to models with different sized data sets
